# Random Password Generator

## Description

- My goal was to create a dynamic website where users can generate a random password. They will be given a prompt when they click the 'Generate Password' button. From there, an alert will pop up and ask if they want specific criteria included in their random password such as, lowercase and uppercase characters. By pressing 'Ok' or 'Cancel' the user will get a random password with the criteria they selected.
- This project is a random password generator and it was made so that users can create a random password.
- Creating this project allowed me to practice use of functions, methods, variables, arrays, etc. By also using the if statement, this allows the user to interact with the dynamic website. They can click the 'Generate Password' button, respond to a prompt, and confirm their choices for their passwords criteria.
